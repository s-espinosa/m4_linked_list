# Linked List Challenge

Checklist:

- [ ] Fix rakefile to actually run all my tests (maybe something wrong with the LinkedList test? Only seems to run using `rspec test/linked_list_test.rb`).
- [ ] Fix sort.
- [ ] Implement remaining methods.
- [ ] Remove `self` where not necessary - consistently use instance variables.
- [ ] Implement remaining functionality from spec.
